    "# MyoSDK Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is MyoSDK?\n",
    "\n",
    "MyoSDK is a Python library that allows you to **Retarget motion** from marker datas onto a 3D character.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will walk you through the complete process:\n",
    "1. Setting up the MyoSDK client\n",
    "2. Apply marker data describing a motion to a 3D character (retargeting)\n",
    "3. Downloading the final animated character file\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting, make sure you have:\n",
    "- **Python 3.8 or higher** installed\n",
    "- **An API key** from MyoLab (you'll need to sign up and get your API key)\n",
    "- **A Mocap file in c3d format** showing a person moving\n",
    "- **A Markerset file ** describing approximately where the markers are placed on the body\n",
    "- **Basic Python knowledge** (understanding variables, functions, and basic syntax)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't installed `myosdk` yet, run this command in your terminal:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install myosdk\n",
    "```"
