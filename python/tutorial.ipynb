    "# MyoSDK Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is MyoSDK?\n",
    "\n",
    "MyoSDK is a Python library that allows you to:\n",
    "- **Extract motion data** from videos (called \"tracking\") - it analyzes a video of a person moving and creates a digital representation of their motion\n",
    "- **Retarget motion** onto 3D characters - it takes the extracted motion and applies it to a 3D character model, making the character move the same way as the person in the video\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will walk you through the complete process:\n",
    "1. Setting up the MyoSDK client\n",
    "2. Exploring available 3D characters\n",
    "3. Uploading a video file\n",
    "4. Extracting motion data from the video (tracking)\n",
    "5. Applying that motion to a 3D character (retargeting)\n",
    "6. Downloading the final animated character file\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting, make sure you have:\n",
    "- **Python 3.8 or higher** installed\n",
    "- **An API key** from MyoLab (you'll need to sign up and get your API key)\n",
    "- **A video file** showing a person moving (MP4 format recommended)\n",
    "- **Basic Python knowledge** (understanding variables, functions, and basic syntax)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't installed `myosdk` yet, run this command in your terminal:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install myosdk\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or if you have the wheel file in this directory:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install myosdk-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl\n",
    "```"

    "\n",
    "Before we start processing videos, let's see what 3D characters are available for retargeting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is retargeting?** Retargeting means taking motion from one source (like a person in a video) and applying it to a different character (like a 3D model). Think of it like copying someone's dance moves and making a 3D character do the same dance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why explore characters first?** You need to know which character you want to use before you can retarget motion onto it. Each character has a unique ID that you'll need later."

    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've completed the full MyoSDK workflow. Here's what you accomplished:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ✅ **Set up the MyoSDK client** - Connected to the service with your API key\n",
    "2. ✅ **Explored available characters** - Found 3D characters you can animate\n",
    "3. ✅ **Uploaded a video** - Sent your video to the platform\n",
    "4. ✅ **Extracted motion** - Analyzed the video to get motion data\n",
    "5. ✅ **Retargeted motion** - Applied the motion to a 3D character\n",
    "6. ✅ **Downloaded the result** - Got your animated GLB file\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Can You Do Next?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use the GLB file in your projects:**\n",
    "  - Import into Blender, Unity, or Unreal Engine\n",
    "  - Use in web applications with Three.js\n",
    "  - Share with others or use in games/animations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Experiment with different videos:**\n",
    "  - Try different types of movement (dancing, sports, gestures)\n",
    "  - Test with different video qualities\n",
    "  - Try different characters from the character list\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Customize the process:**\n",
    "  - Adjust the `fps` parameter for different frame rates\n",
    "  - Try different skeleton types if available\n",
    "  - Experiment with different character versions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Troubleshooting Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "If you encounter issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **API Key Problems:**\n",
    "   - Make sure your API key is correct\n",
    "   - Check that you have an active MyoLab account\n",
    "   - Verify the API key is set in your environment or code\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Video Upload Issues:**\n",
    "   - Check that the file path is correct\n",
    "   - Ensure the video file exists and is readable\n",
    "   - Verify your internet connection\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Job Failures:**\n",
    "   - Check video quality (person should be clearly visible)\n",
    "   - Ensure the video format is supported\n",
    "   - Verify the character_id is valid\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Download Issues:**\n",
    "   - Make sure you have write permissions in the output directory\n",
    "   - Check your internet connection\n",
    "   - Verify the motion_asset_id is correct\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting Help\n",
    "\n",
    "- Check the MyoSDK documentation for more details\n",
    "- Review the API reference for advanced options\n",
    "- Contact MyoLab support if you need assistance\n",
